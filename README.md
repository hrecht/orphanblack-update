# Orphan Black: Data viz - the updating version

Will be updating weekly with new episode data. Builds on my analysis [of the first two seasons](http://hrecht.github.io/orphanblack/).

The data for this page were collected using a strict, consistent, and highly enjoyable but not peer-reviewed method of rewatching all twenty episodes with a spreadsheet open and one hand on the pause button. Scene changes or other breaks less than 10 seconds were ignored. Recaps, title scenes, credits, and previews were excluded from analysis.

Visualizations built in d3. Tools used along the way:
* Excel: collecting data
* R: formatting and cleaning data
* Python: CSV -> JSON
